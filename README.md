# Laravel 5 HTML Minify
`This package is originally from https://github.com/fitztrev/laravel-html-minify i just updated the package and made it compatible with laravel 5`, And i forked and make it simple üòÅ

## About

This package compresses the HTML output from your Laravel 5 application, seamlessly reducing the overall response size of your pages.

Other scripts that I've seen will compress the HTML output on-the-fly for each request. Instead, this package extends the Blade compiler to save the compiled template files to disk in their compressed state, reducing the overhead for each request.

## Why?

Even with gzip enabled, there is still an improvement in the response size for HTML content-type documents.
